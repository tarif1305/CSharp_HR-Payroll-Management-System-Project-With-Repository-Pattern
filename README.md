Case Study: HR Payroll Management System
Project Overview:
The HR Payroll Management System is a simple console application designed to manage employee records and payroll data. Using the Repository Pattern, the system enables seamless management of employee and payroll information with operations like adding, updating, deleting, and searching. It encapsulates data access logic in dedicated repositories, ensuring code modularity and maintainability.

System Features:
Employee Management:

Employees are added with details like name, date of birth, and employment type (FullTime, PartTime, Contractor).
Payroll Management:

Payroll data is linked to employees, including salary and pay period.
CRUD Operations:

Employees and payrolls can be added, updated, or deleted. For example, payroll salaries can be updated, and employees can be removed with their associated payroll records.
Search Functionality:

Users can search employees by name or payroll data by salary and pay period.
Use of Repository Pattern:
The system uses the Repository Pattern for handling data access logic. Each repository (EmployeeRepository, PayrollRepository) provides methods for CRUD operations, isolating business logic from data handling. This design allows for easier future extensions and unit testing.

Implementation Example:
Adding an Employee:

csharp
Copy
Edit
employeeRepository.Add(new Employee(3, "Ashraf", "Uddin", "1996/09/10", EmployeeType.FullTime));
Updating Payroll:

csharp
Copy
Edit
var payrollToUpdate = payrollRepository.FindById(3);
payrollToUpdate.Salary = 70000;
payrollRepository.Update(payrollToUpdate);
Deleting an Employee and Payroll:

csharp
Copy
Edit
var employeeToDelete = employeeRepository.FindById(4);
if (employeeToDelete != null)
{
    payrollRepository.Delete(payrollToDelete);
    employeeRepository.Delete(employeeToDelete);
}
Conclusion:
This HR Payroll Management System simplifies the management of employee and payroll data, promoting scalability and maintainability. Using the Repository Pattern ensures separation of concerns, making the code easier to modify and extend over time.
